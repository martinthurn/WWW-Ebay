# WWW-Ebay
Perl module / backend for WWW::Search that searches password-protected areas of eBay

NOTICE!

Some time in 2018, ebay.com started asking for captcha codes occasionally during login.
Automated systems such as this Perl module are not able to pass the captcha codes,
therefore this module / backend is rendered pretty much useless.
